# Challenges along the way

Today I had a pretty big mistake. I was using `window.getSelection()` and it suddenly stopped working saying it didn't exist during the day after working all yesterday. I was pretty confused and spent an hour or so searching around. Eventually I just switched it to `getSelection()` and that worked just fine. I nearly made a reddit post just asking why that would suddenly stop working still thinking I changed nothing. But what I did was create a state variable to control a pop up window. Of course I named the state variable `window` so infact `window.getSelection()` was not a valid function. Great lesson in scope and namespace issues.
